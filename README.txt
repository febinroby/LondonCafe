    INTRODUCTION
        - Welcome to the README file for the London Cafe website project. This document provides an overview of the design principles, accessibility compliance strategies, and search engine optimization (SEO) techniques implemented in the development of the website.

    DESIGN PRINCIPLES
        - The design of the London Cafe website incorporates several key design principles to enhance user experience and visual appeal:
            - Proximity: Elements such as menu items, contact information, and social media links are grouped together in close proximity to improve user navigation and comprehension.
            - Contrast: High contrast between text and background colors ensures readability and accessibility for all users. Bold imagery and vibrant colors are strategically used to draw attention to key elements and create visual interest.
            - Typography: Carefully selected fonts and font sizes are utilized to maintain consistency and readability across different devices and screen sizes. Headings, paragraphs, and other text elements are styled to prioritize content hierarchy and improve user understanding.
    
    ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE
        - To ensure accessibility compliance and improve inclusivity, the following strategies were implemented:
            - Semantic HTML: Proper use of semantic HTML elements such as <nav>, <header>, <footer>, etc., helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret the content correctly.
            - Alt Text for Images: All images on the website include descriptive alt text to provide context for visually impaired users or users with images disabled.
            - Color Contrast: Ensuring sufficient color contrast between text and background elements enhances readability and accommodates users with visual impairments or color vision deficiencies.
    
    SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (SEO) STRATEGIES
        - To improve visibility and search engine rankings, the following SEO strategies were employed:
            - Keyword Optimization: Relevant keywords related to London Cafe, its offerings, and location are strategically incorporated into website content, meta tags, and headings to improve search engine indexing and ranking.
            - Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive and mobile-friendly, which not only enhances user experience but also improves search engine rankings as per Google's mobile-first indexing criteria.
            - Meta Tags and Descriptions: Each page of the website includes unique meta titles and descriptions optimized with relevant keywords to improve click-through rates and search engine visibility.
